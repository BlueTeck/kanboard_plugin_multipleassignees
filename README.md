# Kanboard Plugin MultipleAssignees

Assign multiple users or groups to a task.

This plugin was inspired by [creecros Group_assign](https://github.com/creecros/Group_assign) plugin.
I built another plugin to maximize the compatiblity to other plugins (no overwritten standard files, just using plugin hooks).

Plugin for https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard
